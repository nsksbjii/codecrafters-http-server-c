   3   │ This is a starting point for C solutions to the
   4   │ ["Build Your Own HTTP server" Challenge](https://app.codecrafters.io/courses/http-server/overview).
   5   │ 
   6   │ [HTTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol) is the
   7   │ protocol that powers the web. In this challenge, you'll build a HTTP/1.1 server
   8   │ that is capable of serving multiple clients.
   9   │ 
  10   │ Along the way you'll learn about TCP servers,
  11   │ [HTTP request syntax](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec5.html),
  12   │ and more.
  13   │ 
  14   │ **Note**: If you're viewing this repo on GitHub, head over to
  15   │ [codecrafters.io](https://codecrafters.io) to try the challenge.

  17   │ # Passing the first stage
  18   │ 
  19   │ The entry point for your HTTP server implementation is in `app/server.c`. Study
  20   │ and uncomment the relevant code, and push your changes to pass the first stage:
  21   │ 
  22   │ ```sh
  23   │ git add .
  24   │ git commit -m "pass 1st stage" # any msg
  25   │ git push origin master
  26   │ ```
  27   │ 
  28   │ Time to move on to the next stage!
  29   │ 
  30   │ # Stage 2 & beyond
  31   │ 
  32   │ Note: This section is for stages 2 and beyond.
  33   │ 
  34   │ 1. Ensure you have `gcc` installed locally
  35   │ 1. Run `./your_server.sh` to run your program, which is implemented in
  36   │    `app/server.c`.
  37   │ 1. Commit your changes and run `git push origin master` to submit your solution
  38   │    to CodeCrafters. Test output will be streamed to your terminal.
